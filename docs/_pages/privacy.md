## Personal Data
OptiPie had never collected and will never collect any personal data, sensitive data, browsing history etc. from user.

In the future OptiPie may collect browser version, platform name, and user's optimization settings and reports anonymously (except website lists or any other data that can help identify the user). This information is needed for decisions on implementing new features, removing unused features or suggesting default settings for new users. It will happen only with the user's consent.

## Third Party Services
OptiPie uses Chrome (Chromium) or WebExtensions Web Storage Local API (localStorage) for storing the user's last optimization settings and optimization report outputs. All saved data to Chrome Local Storage consists of scraped data within 'tradingview.com' domain and the user's optimization settings without any personally identifiable information. OptiPie works as an "Offline" extension, just using the Chrome Local Storage and does not store any personal or sensitive data from the user.

Donations are processed by 'www.buymeacoffee.com' and payment processors chosen by that organization (Stripe and Bank Transfers).

## The Website
For statistical purposes optipie.app website counts page visits and link clicks using Google Analytics. A language and a time zone of a visitor are sent to the web server anonymously.
